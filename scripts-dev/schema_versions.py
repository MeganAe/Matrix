"""A script to calculate which versions of Synapse have backwards-compatible
database schemas. It creates a Markdown table of Synapse versions and the earliest
compatible version.

It is compatible with the mdbook protocol for preprocessors (see
https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/preprocessors.html#implementing-a-preprocessor-with-a-different-language):

Exit 0 to denote support for all renderers:

    ./scripts-dev/schema_versions.py supports <mdbook renderer>

Parse a JSON list from stdin and add the table to the proper documetnation page:

    ./scripts-dev/schema_versions.py

Additionally, the script supports dumping the table to stdout for debugging:

    ./scripts-dev/schema_versions.py dump
