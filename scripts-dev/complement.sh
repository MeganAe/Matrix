# This script is designed for developers who want to test their code
# against Complement.
#
# It makes a Synapse image which represents the current checkout,
# builds a synapse-complement image on top, then runs tests with it.
#
# By default the script will fetch the latest Complement main branch and
# run tests with that. This can be overridden to use a custom Complement
# checkout by setting the COMPLEMENT_DIR environment variable to the
# filepath of a local Complement checkout or by setting the COMPLEMENT_REF
# environment variable to pull a different branch or commit.
#
# By default Synapse is run in monolith mode. This can be overridden by
# setting the WORKERS environment variable.
#
# You can optionally give a "-f" argument (for "fast") before any to skip
# rebuilding the docker images, if you just want to rerun the tests.
#
# Remaining commandline arguments are passed through to `go test`. For example,
# you can supply a regular expression of test method names via the "-run"
# argument:
#
# ./complement.sh -run "TestOutboundFederation(Profile|Send)"
#
# Specifying TEST_ONLY_SKIP_DEP_HASH_VERIFICATION=1 will cause `poetry export`
# to not emit any hashes when building the Docker image. This then means that
# you can use 'unverifiable' sources such as git repositories as dependencies.

# Exit if a line returns a non-zero exit code

Usage: $0 [-f] <go test arguments>...
Run the complement test suite on Synapse.

  -f, --fast
        Skip rebuilding the docker images, and just use the most recent
        'complement-synapse:latest' image.
        Conflicts with --build-only.

  --build-only
        Only build the Docker images. Don't actually run Complement.
        Conflicts with -f/--fast.

For help on arguments to 'go test', run 'go help testflag'.
