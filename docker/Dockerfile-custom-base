# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Dockerfile to build the matrixdotorg/synapse docker images.
#
# Note that it uses features which are only available in BuildKit - see
# https://docs.docker.com/go/buildkit/ for more information.
#
# To build the image, run `docker build` command from the root of the
# synapse repository:
#
#    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .
#
# There is an optional BASE_IMAGE build argument which sets the
# base image being used, this must be a debian bullseye derivative
# image with python already installed and in the $PATH.
# e.g pyston/slim:2.3.3 or docker.io/python:3.9-slim (default)
#
#    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=pyston/slim:2.3.3 .
#

# Irritatingly, there is no blessed guide on how to distribute an application with its
# poetry-managed environment in a docker image. We have opted for
# `poetry export | pip install -r /dev/stdin`, but there are known bugs in
# in `poetry export` whose fixes (scheduled for poetry 1.2) have yet to be released.
# In case we get bitten by those bugs in the future, the recommendations here might
# be useful:

# We install poetry in its own prefix to avoid its dependencies conflicting with

# We use a specific commit from poetry's master branch instead of our usual 1.1.12,
# to incorporate fixes to some bugs in `poetry export`. This commit corresponds to
#    https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/5156 and
#    https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/5141 ;
# without it, we generate a requirements.txt with incorrect environment markers,
