# This script reads environment variables and generates a shared Synapse worker,
# nginx and supervisord configs depending on the workers requested.
#
# The environment variables it reads are:
#   * SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME: The desired server_name of the homeserver.
#   * SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS: Whether to report stats.
#   * SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES: A comma separated list of worker names as specified in WORKERS_CONFIG
#         below. Leave empty for no workers. Add a ':' and a number at the end to
#         multiply that worker. Append multiple worker types with '+' to merge the
#         worker types into a single worker. Add a name and a '=' to the front of a
#         worker type to give this instance a name in logs and nginx.
#         Examples:
#         SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES='event_persister, federation_sender, client_reader'
#         SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES='event_persister:2, federation_sender:2, client_reader'
#         SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES='stream_writers=account_data+presence+typing'
#   * SYNAPSE_AS_REGISTRATION_DIR: If specified, a directory in which .yaml and .yml files
#         will be treated as Application Service registration files.
#   * SYNAPSE_TLS_CERT: Path to a TLS certificate in PEM format.
#   * SYNAPSE_TLS_KEY: Path to a TLS key. If this and SYNAPSE_TLS_CERT are specified,
#         Nginx will be configured to serve TLS on port 8448.
#   * SYNAPSE_USE_EXPERIMENTAL_FORKING_LAUNCHER: Whether to use the forking launcher,
#         only intended for usage in Complement at the moment.
#         No stability guarantees are provided.
#   * SYNAPSE_LOG_LEVEL: Set this to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or ERROR to change the
#         log level. INFO is the default.
#   * SYNAPSE_LOG_SENSITIVE: If unset, SQL and SQL values won't be logged,
#         regardless of the SYNAPSE_LOG_LEVEL setting.
#
# NOTE: According to Complement's ENTRYPOINT expectations for a homeserver image (as defined
# in the project's README), this script may be run multiple times, and functionality should
# continue to work if so.
