Basically, PEP8

- Max line width: 80 chars.
- Use camel case for class and type names
- Use underscores for functions and variables.
- Use double quotes.
- Use parentheses instead of '\' for line continuation where ever possible (which is pretty much everywhere)
- There should be max a single new line between:
    - statements
    - functions in a class
- There should be two new lines between:
    - definitions in a module (e.g., between different classes)
- There should be spaces where spaces should be and not where there shouldn't be:
    - a single space after a comma
    - a single space before and after for '=' when used as assignment
    - no spaces before and after for '=' for default values and keyword arguments.

Comments should follow the google code style. This is so that we can generate documentation with sphinx (http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
