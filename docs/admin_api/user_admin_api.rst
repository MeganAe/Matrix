Query User Account
==================

This API returns information about a specific user account.

The api is::

    GET /_synapse/admin/v2/users/<user_id>

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an ``access_token`` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

It returns a JSON body like the following:

.. code:: json

    {
        "displayname": "User",
        "threepids": [
            {
                "medium": "email",
                "address": "<user_mail_1>"
            },
            {
                "medium": "email",
                "address": "<user_mail_2>"
            }
        ],
        "avatar_url": "<avatar_url>",
        "admin": false,
        "deactivated": false
    }

URL parameters:

- ``user_id``: fully-qualified user id: for example, ``@user:server.com``.

Create or modify Account
========================

This API allows an administrator to create or modify a user account with a
specific ``user_id``.

This api is::

    PUT /_synapse/admin/v2/users/<user_id>

with a body of:

.. code:: json

    {
        "password": "user_password",
        "displayname": "User",
        "threepids": [
            {
                "medium": "email",
                "address": "<user_mail_1>"
            },
            {
                "medium": "email",
                "address": "<user_mail_2>"
            }
        ],
        "avatar_url": "<avatar_url>",
        "admin": false,
        "deactivated": false
    }

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an ``access_token`` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

URL parameters:

- ``user_id``: fully-qualified user id: for example, ``@user:server.com``.

Body parameters:

- ``password``, optional. If provided, the user's password is updated and all
  devices are logged out.

- ``displayname``, optional, defaults to the value of ``user_id``.

- ``threepids``, optional, allows setting the third-party IDs (email, msisdn)
  belonging to a user.

- ``avatar_url``, optional, must be a
  `MXC URI <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#matrix-content-mxc-uris>`_.

- ``admin``, optional, defaults to ``false``.

- ``deactivated``, optional. If unspecified, deactivation state will be left
  unchanged on existing accounts and set to ``false`` for new accounts.

If the user already exists then optional parameters default to the current value.

In order to re-activate an account ``deactivated`` must be set to ``false``. If
users do not login via single-sign-on, a new ``password`` must be provided.

List Accounts
=============

This API returns all local user accounts.

The api is::

    GET /_synapse/admin/v2/users?from=0&limit=10&guests=false

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an `access_token` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

The parameter ``from`` is optional but used for pagination, denoting the
offset in the returned results. This should be treated as an opaque value and
not explicitly set to anything other than the return value of ``next_token``
from a previous call.

The parameter ``limit`` is optional but is used for pagination, denoting the
maximum number of items to return in this call. Defaults to ``100``.

The parameter ``user_id`` is optional and filters to only users with user IDs
that contain this value.

The parameter ``guests`` is optional and if ``false`` will **exclude** guest users.
Defaults to ``true`` to include guest users.

The parameter ``deactivated`` is optional and if ``true`` will **include** deactivated users.
Defaults to ``false`` to exclude deactivated users.

A JSON body is returned with the following shape:

.. code:: json

    {
        "users": [
            {
                "name": "<user_id1>",
                "password_hash": "<password_hash1>",
                "is_guest": 0,
                "admin": 0,
                "user_type": null,
                "deactivated": 0,
                "displayname": "<User One>",
                "avatar_url": null
            }, {
                "name": "<user_id2>",
                "password_hash": "<password_hash2>",
                "is_guest": 0,
                "admin": 1,
                "user_type": null,
                "deactivated": 0,
                "displayname": "<User Two>",
                "avatar_url": "<avatar_url>"
            }
        ],
        "next_token": "100",
        "total": 200
    }

To paginate, check for ``next_token`` and if present, call the endpoint again
with ``from`` set to the value of ``next_token``. This will return a new page.

If the endpoint does not return a ``next_token`` then there are no more users
to paginate through.

Query current sessions for a user
=================================

This API returns information about the active sessions for a specific user.

The api is::

    GET /_synapse/admin/v1/whois/<user_id>

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an ``access_token`` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

It returns a JSON body like the following:

.. code:: json

    {
        "user_id": "<user_id>",
        "devices": {
            "": {
                "sessions": [
                    {
                        "connections": [
                            {
                                "ip": "1.2.3.4",
                                "last_seen": 1417222374433,
                                "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
                            },
                            {
                                "ip": "1.2.3.10",
                                "last_seen": 1417222374500,
                                "user_agent": "Dalvik/2.1.0 ..."
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

``last_seen`` is measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

Deactivate Account
==================

This API deactivates an account. It removes active access tokens, resets the
password, and deletes third-party IDs (to prevent the user requesting a
password reset). It can also mark the user as GDPR-erased (stopping their data
from distributed further, and deleting it entirely if there are no other
references to it).

The api is::

    POST /_synapse/admin/v1/deactivate/<user_id>

with a body of:

.. code:: json

    {
        "erase": true
    }

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an ``access_token`` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

The erase parameter is optional and defaults to ``false``.
An empty body may be passed for backwards compatibility.


Reset password
==============

The api is::

    POST /_synapse/admin/v1/reset_password/<user_id>

with a body of:

.. code:: json

   {
       "new_password": "<secret>",
       "logout_devices": true,
   }

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an ``access_token`` for a
server admin: see `README.rst <README.rst>`_.

The parameter ``new_password`` is required.
The parameter ``logout_devices`` is optional and defaults to ``true``.

Get whether a user is a server administrator or not
===================================================


The api is::
