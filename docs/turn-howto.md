# Overview

This document explains how to enable VoIP relaying on your Home Server with
TURN.

The synapse Matrix Home Server supports integration with TURN server via the
[TURN server REST API](<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00>). This
allows the Home Server to generate credentials that are valid for use on the
TURN server through the use of a secret shared between the Home Server and the
TURN server.

The following sections describe how to install [coturn](<https://github.com/coturn/coturn>) (which implements the TURN REST API) and integrate it with synapse.

## `coturn` Setup

### Initial installation

The TURN daemon `coturn` is available from a variety of sources such as native package managers, or installation from source.

#### Debian installation

    # apt install coturn

#### Source installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/releases/latest) from github.  Unpack it and `cd` into the directory.

1.  Configure it:

        ./configure

    > You may need to install `libevent2`: if so, you should do so in
    > the way recommended by your operating system. You can ignore
    > warnings about lack of database support: a database is unnecessary
    > for this purpose.

1.  Build and install it:

        make
        make install

### Configuration

1.  Create or edit the config file in `/etc/turnserver.conf`. The relevant
    lines, with example values, are:

        use-auth-secret
        static-auth-secret=[your secret key here]
        realm=turn.myserver.org

    See `turnserver.conf` for explanations of the options. One way to generate
    the `static-auth-secret` is with `pwgen`:

        pwgen -s 64 1

1.  Consider your security settings. TURN lets users request a relay which will
    connect to arbitrary IP addresses and ports. The following configuration is
    suggested as a minimum starting point:
    
        # VoIP traffic is all UDP. There is no reason to let users connect to arbitrary TCP endpoints via the relay.
        no-tcp-relay
        
        # don't let the relay ever try to connect to private IP address ranges within your network (if any)
        # given the turn server is likely behind your firewall, remember to include any privileged public IPs too.
        denied-peer-ip=10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
        denied-peer-ip=192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
        denied-peer-ip=172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
        
        # special case the turn server itself so that client->TURN->TURN->client flows work
        allowed-peer-ip=10.0.0.1
        
        # consider whether you want to limit the quota of relayed streams per user (or total) to avoid risk of DoS.
        user-quota=12 # 4 streams per video call, so 12 streams = 3 simultaneous relayed calls per user.
        total-quota=1200

    Ideally coturn should refuse to relay traffic which isn't SRTP; see
    <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2009>

1.  Ensure your firewall allows traffic into the TURN server on the ports
    you've configured it to listen on (remember to allow both TCP and UDP TURN
    traffic)

1.  If you've configured coturn to support TLS/DTLS, generate or import your
    private key and certificate.

1.  Start the turn server:

         bin/turnserver -o

## synapse Setup

Your home server configuration file needs the following extra keys:

1.  "`turn_uris`": This needs to be a yaml list of public-facing URIs
    for your TURN server to be given out to your clients. Add separate
    entries for each transport your TURN server supports.
2.  "`turn_shared_secret`": This is the secret shared between your
    Home server and your TURN server, so you should set it to the same
    string you used in turnserver.conf.
3.  "`turn_user_lifetime`": This is the amount of time credentials
    generated by your Home Server are valid for (in milliseconds).
    Shorter times offer less potential for abuse at the expense of
    increased traffic between web clients and your home server to
    refresh credentials. The TURN REST API specification recommends
    one day (86400000).
4.  "`turn_allow_guests`": Whether to allow guest users to use the
    TURN server. This is enabled by default, as otherwise VoIP will
    not work reliably for guests. However, it does introduce a
    security risk as it lets guests connect to arbitrary endpoints
    without having gone through a CAPTCHA or similar to register a
    real account.

As an example, here is the relevant section of the config file for matrix.org:

    turn_uris: [ "turn:turn.matrix.org:3478?transport=udp", "turn:turn.matrix.org:3478?transport=tcp" ]
    turn_shared_secret: n0t4ctuAllymatr1Xd0TorgSshar3d5ecret4obvIousreAsons
    turn_user_lifetime: 86400000
    turn_allow_guests: True

After updating the homeserver configuration, you must restart synapse:

    cd /where/you/run/synapse
    ./synctl restart

..and your Home Server now supports VoIP relaying!
