  could take several hours for servers to start talking to ressurected servers,
  even when they were receiving traffic from them (PR #393)

Changes in synapse v0.10.0-rc1 (2015-08-21)
===========================================

Also see v0.9.4-rc1 changelog, which has been amalgamated into this release.

General:

* Upgrade to Twisted 15 (PR #173)
* Add support for serving and fetching encryption keys over federation.
  (PR #208)
* Add support for logging in with email address (PR #234)
* Add support for new ``m.room.canonical_alias`` event. (PR #233)
* Change synapse to treat user IDs case insensitively during registration and
  login. (If two users already exist with case insensitive matching user ids,
  synapse will continue to require them to specify their user ids exactly.)
* Error if a user tries to register with an email already in use. (PR #211)
* Add extra and improve existing caches  (PR #212, #219, #226, #228)

* Fix bug where we didn't correctly log the entity that triggered the request
  if the request came in via an application service (PR #230)
* Fix bug where we needlessly regenerated the full list of rooms an AS is
  interested in. (PR #232)
* Add support for AS's to use v2_alpha registration API (PR #210)


Configuration:

* Add ``--generate-keys`` that will generate any missing cert and key files in
  the configuration files. This is equivalent to running ``--generate-config``
  on an existing configuration file. (PR #220)
* ``--generate-config`` now no longer requires a ``--server-name`` parameter
  when used on existing configuration files. (PR #220)
* Add ``--print-pidfile`` flag that controls the printing of the pid to stdout
  of the demonised process. (PR #213)

Media Repository:

* Fix bug where we picked a lower resolution image than requested. (PR #205)
* Add support for specifying if a the media repository should dynamically
  thumbnail images or not. (PR #206)

Metrics:

* Add statistics from the reactor to the metrics API. (PR #224, #225)

Demo Homeservers:

* Fix starting the demo homeservers without rate-limiting enabled. (PR #182)
* Fix enabling registration on demo homeservers (PR #223)


Changes in synapse v0.9.4-rc1 (2015-07-21)
==========================================

General:

* Add basic implementation of receipts. (SPEC-99)
* Add support for configuration presets in room creation API. (PR  #203)
* Add auth event that limits the visibility of history for new users.
  (SPEC-134)
* Add SAML2 login/registration support. (PR  #201. Thanks Muthu Subramanian!)

  levels of users that have equal or greater power level than you. (SYN-192)
* Improve performance by bulk inserting events where possible. (PR #193)
* Improve performance by bulk verifying signatures where possible. (PR #194)


Configuration:

* Add support for including TLS certificate chains.

Changes in synapse v0.9.3 (2015-07-01)
======================================

No changes from v0.9.3 Release Candidate 1.

Changes in synapse v0.9.3-rc1 (2015-06-23)
==========================================

General:

* Fix a memory leak in the notifier. (SYN-412)
* Improve performance of room initial sync. (SYN-418)
* General improvements to logging.
* Remove ``access_token`` query params from ``INFO`` level logging.

Configuration:

* Add support for specifying and configuring multiple listeners. (SYN-389)

Application services:

* Fix bug where synapse failed to send user queries to application services.

Changes in synapse v0.9.2-r2 (2015-06-15)
=========================================

Fix packaging so that schema delta python files get included in the package.

Changes in synapse v0.9.2 (2015-06-12)
======================================

General:

* Use ultrajson for json (de)serialisation when a canonical encoding is not
  required. Ultrajson is significantly faster than simplejson in certain
  circumstances.
* Use connection pools for outgoing HTTP connections.
* Process thumbnails on separate threads.

Configuration:

* Add option, ``gzip_responses``, to disable HTTP response compression.

Federation:

* Improve resilience of backfill by ensuring we fetch any missing auth events.
* Improve performance of backfill and joining remote rooms by removing
  unnecessary computations. This included handling events we'd previously
  handled as well as attempting to compute the current state for outliers.


Changes in synapse v0.9.1 (2015-05-26)
======================================

General:

* Add support for backfilling when a client paginates. This allows servers to
  request history for a room from remote servers when a client tries to
  paginate history the server does not have - SYN-36
* Fix bug where you couldn't disable non-default pushrules - SYN-378
* Fix ``register_new_user`` script - SYN-359
* Improve performance of fetching events from the database, this improves both
  initialSync and sending of events.
* Improve performance of event streams, allowing synapse to handle more
  simultaneous connected clients.

Federation:

* Fix bug with existing backfill implementation where it returned the wrong
  selection of events in some circumstances.
* Improve performance of joining remote rooms.

Configuration:

* Add support for changing the bind host of the metrics listener via the
  ``metrics_bind_host`` option.


Changes in synapse v0.9.0-r5 (2015-05-21)
=========================================

* Add more database caches to reduce amount of work done for each pusher. This
  radically reduces CPU usage when multiple pushers are set up in the same room.

Changes in synapse v0.9.0 (2015-05-07)
======================================

General:

* Add support for using a PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite. See
  `docs/postgres.rst`_ for details.
* Add password change and reset APIs. See `Registration`_ in the spec.
* Fix memory leak due to not releasing stale notifiers - SYN-339.
* Fix race in caches that occasionally caused some presence updates to be
  dropped - SYN-369.
* Check server name has not changed on restart.
* Add a sample systemd unit file and a logger configuration in
  contrib/systemd. Contributed Ivan Shapovalov.

Federation:

* Add key distribution mechanisms for fetching public keys of unavailable
  remote home servers. See `Retrieving Server Keys`_ in the spec.

Configuration:

* Add support for multiple config files.
* Add support for dictionaries in config files.
* Remove support for specifying config options on the command line, except
  for:

  * ``--daemonize`` - Daemonize the home server.
  * ``--manhole`` - Turn on the twisted telnet manhole service on the given
    port.
  * ``--database-path`` - The path to a sqlite database to use.
  * ``--verbose`` - The verbosity level.
  * ``--log-file`` - File to log to.
  * ``--log-config`` - Python logging config file.
  * ``--enable-registration`` - Enable registration for new users.

Application services:

* Reliably retry sending of events from Synapse to application services, as per
  `Application Services`_ spec.
* Application services can no longer register via the ``/register`` API,
  instead their configuration should be saved to a file and listed in the
  synapse ``app_service_config_files`` config option. The AS configuration file
  has the same format as the old ``/register`` request.

Changes in synapse v0.8.1 (2015-03-18)
======================================

* Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the command
  ``register_new_matrix_user`` or by enabling registration in the config.
* Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options
  ``enable_metrics`` and ``metrics_port``.
* Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.

Changes in synapse v0.8.0 (2015-03-06)
======================================

General:

* Add support for registration fallback. This is a page hosted on the server
  which allows a user to register for an account, regardless of what client
  they are using (e.g. mobile devices).

* Added new default push rules and made them configurable by clients:

  * Suppress all notice messages.
  * Notify when invited to a new room.
  * Notify for messages that don't match any rule.
  * Notify on incoming call.

Federation:

* Added per host server side rate-limiting of incoming federation requests.
* Added a ``/get_missing_events/`` API to federation to reduce number of
  ``/events/`` requests.

Configuration:

* Added configuration option to disable registration:
  ``disable_registration``.
* Added configuration option to change soft limit of number of open file
  descriptors: ``soft_file_limit``.
* Make ``tls_private_key_path`` optional when running with ``no_tls``.

Application services:

* Application services can now poll on the CS API ``/events`` for their events,
  by providing their application service ``access_token``.
* Added exclusive namespace support to application services API.


Changes in synapse v0.7.1 (2015-02-19)
======================================

* Initial alpha implementation of parts of the Application Services API.
  Including:

  - AS Registration / Unregistration
  - User Query API
  - Room Alias Query API
  - Push transport for receiving events.
  - User/Alias namespace admin control

* Add cache when fetching events from remote servers to stop repeatedly
  fetching events with bad signatures.
* Respect the per remote server retry scheme when fetching both events and
  server keys to reduce the number of times we send requests to dead servers.
* Inform remote servers when the local server fails to handle a received event.
* Turn off python bytecode generation due to problems experienced when
  upgrading from previous versions.

Changes in synapse v0.7.0 (2015-02-12)
======================================

* Add initial implementation of the query auth federation API, allowing
  servers to agree on whether an event should be allowed or rejected.
* Persist events we have rejected from federation, fixing the bug where
  servers would keep requesting the same events.
* Various federation performance improvements, including:

  - Add in memory caches on queries such as:

     * Computing the state of a room at a point in time, used for
       authorization on federation requests.
     * Fetching events from the database.
     * User's room membership, used for authorizing presence updates.

  - Upgraded JSON library to improve parsing and serialisation speeds.

* Add default avatars to new user accounts using pydenticon library.
* Correctly time out federation requests.
* Retry federation requests against different servers.
* Add support for push and push rules.
* Add alpha versions of proposed new CSv2 APIs, including ``/sync`` API.

Changes in synapse 0.6.1 (2015-01-07)
=====================================

* Major optimizations to improve performance of initial sync and event sending
  in large rooms (by up to 10x)
* Media repository now includes a Content-Length header on media downloads.
* Improve quality of thumbnails by changing resizing algorithm.

Changes in synapse 0.6.0 (2014-12-16)
=====================================

* Add new API for media upload and download that supports thumbnailing.
* Replicate media uploads over multiple homeservers so media is always served
  to clients from their local homeserver.  This obsoletes the
  --content-addr parameter and confusion over accessing content directly
  from remote homeservers.
* Implement exponential backoff when retrying federation requests when
  sending to remote homeservers which are offline.
* Implement typing notifications.
* Fix bugs where we sent events with invalid signatures due to bugs where
  we incorrectly persisted events.
* Improve performance of database queries involving retrieving events.

* Fix potential memory leak.

Changes in synapse 0.5.3c (2014-12-02)
======================================

  listener, as by default the HTTPS listener will be using a self-signed
  certificate.
