Fix a bug introduced in Synapse v1.25.0 that prevented the `ip_range_whitelist` configuration option from working for federation and identity servers. Contributed by @mikure.
Notice that this change will not be applied, if your configuration still uses 'federation_ip_range_blacklist', to allow backwards-compatibility.
