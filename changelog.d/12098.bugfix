Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.51.0rc1 where incoming federation transactions containing at least one EDU would be dropped if debug logging was enabled for `synapse.8631_debug`. Synapse 1.53.0rc1 included a partial fix this ([#11890](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11890)), but the fix was incorrect: EDUs containing device list or signing key updates would still be dropped.
