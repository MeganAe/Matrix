Revert behaviour introduced in v1.38.0 that strips `org.matrix.msc2732.device_unused_fallback_key_types` from `/sync` when its value is empty. This field should instead always be present according to [MSC2732](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2732-olm-fallback-keys.md).
