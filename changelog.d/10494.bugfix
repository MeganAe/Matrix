Allow the URI scheme between the request and the `public_baseurl` to differ while still redirecting correctly when performing SSO logins. ([\#10494](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10494)). Fixes a regression introduced by ([\#9436]https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9436) that impacts servers behind a reverse proxy where the `public_baseurl` points to the TLS termination endpoint, but the request is proxied over unecrypted http to the local server.
