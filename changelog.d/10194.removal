Remove Synapse's support for automatically fetching and renewing certificates using the ACME v1 protocol. This protocol has been fully turned off by Let's Encrypt for existing install on June 1st 2021. Admins previously using this feature should use a [reverse proxy](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/reverse_proxy.html) to handle TLS termination, or use an external ACME client (such as [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)) to retrieve a certificate and key and provide them to Synapse using the `tls_certificate_path` and `tls_private_key_path` configuration settings.
