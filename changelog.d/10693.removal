Remove [unstable MSC2858 API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2858-Multiple-SSO-Identity-Providers.md#unstable-prefix), including the undocumented `experimental.msc2858_enabled` config option. The unstable API has been deprecated since Synapse 1.35. Client authors should update their clients to use the stable API introduced in Synapse 1.30 if they have not already done so.
