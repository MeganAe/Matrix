Port spam-checker API callbacks `user_may_join_room`, `user_may_invite`, `user_may_send_3pid_invite`, `user_may_create_room`, `user_may_create_room_alias`, `user_may_publish_room`, `check_media_file_for_spam` to more powerful and less ambiguous `Union[Literal["NOT_SPAM"], Codes]`. This is a followup to #12703, #12808, #12846 and builds towards giving the spam-checker API the ability to inform users of *why* their event or operation has been rejected.
