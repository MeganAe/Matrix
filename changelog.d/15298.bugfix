Fix a bug in which the [`POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/report/{eventId}`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidreporteventid) endpoint would return the wrong error if the user did not have permission to view the event. This aligns Synapse's implementation with [MSC2249](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2249).
