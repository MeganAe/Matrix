Update database maintenance tools documentation to include a recent blog post (originally written on Dec 3, 2022 and continues to receive updates, last update on Feb 7, 2023) to replace the commonly suggested blog post from 2020 which commands do not work. This new recent blog post was shared by its author in the Matrix Synapse Admin room after I had experienced tons of frustration not getting anything to work in the ancient blog post from 2020, so I'm updating this documentation to help others not get completely frustrated when maintaining their homeservers.
