"""Responsible for storing and fetching push actions / notifications.

There are two main uses for push actions:
  1. Sending out push to a user's device; and
  2. Tracking per-room per-user notification counts (used in sync requests).

For the former we simply use the `event_push_actions` table, which contains all
the calculated actions for a given user (which were calculated by the
`BulkPushRuleEvaluator`).

For the latter we could simply count the number of rows in `event_push_actions`
table for a given room/user, but in practice this is *very* heavyweight when
there were a large number of notifications (due to e.g. the user never reading a
room). Plus, keeping all push actions indefinitely uses a lot of disk space.

To fix these issues, we add a new table `event_push_summary` that tracks
per-user per-room counts of all notifications that happened before a stream
ordering S. Thus, to get the notification count for a user / room we can simply
query a single row in `event_push_summary` and count the number of rows in
`event_push_actions` with a stream ordering larger than S (and as long as S is
"recent", the number of rows needing to be scanned will be small).

The `event_push_summary` table is updated via a background job that periodically
chooses a new stream ordering S' (usually the latest stream ordering), counts
all notifications in `event_push_actions` between the existing S and S', and
adds them to the existing counts in `event_push_summary`.

This allows us to delete old rows from `event_push_actions` once those rows have
been counted and added to `event_push_summary` (we call this process
"rotation").


We need to handle when a user sends a read receipt to the room. Again this is
done as a background process. For each receipt we clear the row in
`event_push_summary` and count the number of notifications in
`event_push_actions` that happened after the receipt but before S, and insert
that count into `event_push_summary` (If the receipt happened *after* S then we
simply clear the `event_push_summary`.)

Note that its possible that if the read receipt is for an old event the relevant
`event_push_actions` rows will have been rotated and we get the wrong count
(it'll be too low). We accept this as a rare edge case that is unlikely to
impact the user much (since the vast majority of read receipts will be for the
latest event).

The last complication is to handle the race where we request the notifications
counts after a user sends a read receipt into the room, but *before* the
background update handles the receipt (without any special handling the counts
would be outdated). We fix this by including in `event_push_summary` the read
receipt we used when updating `event_push_summary`, and every time we query the
table we check if that matches the most recent read receipt in the room. If yes,
continue as above, if not we simply query the `event_push_actions` table
directly.

Since read receipts are almost always for recent events, scanning the
`event_push_actions` table in this case is unlikely to be a problem. Even if it
is a problem, it is temporary until the background job handles the new read
receipt.
