        # Originally the state store used a single DictionaryCache to cache the
        # event IDs for the state types in a given state group to avoid hammering
        # on the state_group* tables.
        #
        # The point of using a DictionaryCache is that it can cache a subset
        # of the state events for a given state group (i.e. a subset of the keys for a
        # given dict which is an entry in the cache for a given state group ID).
        #
        # However, this poses problems when performing complicated queries
        # on the store - for instance: "give me all the state for this group, but
        # limit members to this subset of users", as DictionaryCache's API isn't
        # rich enough to say "please cache any of these fields, apart from this subset".
        # This is problematic when lazy loading members, which requires this behaviour,
        # as without it the cache has no choice but to speculatively load all
        # state events for the group, which negates the efficiency being sought.
        #
        # Rather than overcomplicating DictionaryCache's API, we instead split the
        # state_group_cache into two halves - one for tracking non-member events,
        # and the other for tracking member_events.  This means that lazy loading
        # queries can be made in a cache-friendly manner by querying both caches
        # separately and then merging the result.  So for the example above, you
        # would query the members cache for a specific subset of state keys
        # (which DictionaryCache will handle efficiently and fine) and the non-members
        # cache for all state (which DictionaryCache will similarly handle fine)
        # and then just merge the results together.
