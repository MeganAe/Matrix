-- The thread_id columns can now be made non-nullable, this is done by using a
-- constraint (and not altering the column) to avoid taking out a full table lock.
--
-- We initially add an invalid constraint which guards against new data (this
-- doesn't lock the table).
ALTER TABLE event_push_actions_staging
    ADD CONSTRAINT event_push_actions_staging_thread_id CHECK (thread_id IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE event_push_actions
    ADD CONSTRAINT event_push_actions_thread_id CHECK (thread_id IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE event_push_summary
    ADD CONSTRAINT event_push_summary_thread_id CHECK (thread_id IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;

-- We then validate the constraint which doesn't need to worry about new data. It
-- only needs a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock but can still take a while to complete.
INSERT INTO background_updates (ordering, update_name, progress_json) VALUES
  (7605, 'event_push_actions_staging_thread_id', '{}'),
  (7605, 'event_push_actions_thread_id', '{}'),
  (7605, 'event_push_summary_thread_id', '{}');

-- Drop the indexes used to find null thread_ids.
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS event_push_actions_thread_id_null;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS event_push_summary_thread_id_null;
