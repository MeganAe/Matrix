-- SQLite needs to rebuild indices which use partial indices on Postgres, but
-- previously did not use them on SQLite.

-- Drop each index that was added with register_background_index_update AND specified
-- a where_clause (that existed before this delta).

-- From events_bg_updates.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS event_contains_url_index;
-- There is also a redactions_censored_redacts index, but that gets dropped.
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS redactions_have_censored_ts;
-- There is also a PostgreSQL only index (event_contains_url_index2)
-- which gets renamed to event_contains_url_index.

-- From roommember.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS room_memberships_user_room_forgotten;

-- From presence.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS presence_stream_state_not_offline_idx;

-- From media_repository.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS local_media_repository_url_idx;

-- From event_push_actions.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS event_push_actions_highlights_index;
-- There's also a event_push_actions_stream_highlight_index which was previously
-- PostgreSQL-only.

-- From state.py
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS current_state_events_member_index;

-- Re-insert the background jobs to re-create the indices.
