    Holds information relevant to persisting an event

    Attributes:
        rejected: A rejection reason if the event was rejected, else None

        _state_group: The ID of the state group for this event. Note that state events
            are persisted with a state group which includes the new event, so this is
            effectively the state *after* the event in question.

            For a *rejected* state event, where the state of the rejected event is
            ignored, this state_group should never make it into the
            event_to_state_groups table. Indeed, inspecting this value for a rejected
            state event is almost certainly incorrect.

            For an outlier, where we don't have the state at the event, this will be
            None.

            Note that this is a private attribute: it should be accessed via
            the ``state_group`` property.

        state_group_before_event: The ID of the state group representing the state
            of the room before this event.

            If this is a non-state event, this will be the same as ``state_group``. If
            it's a state event, it will be the same as ``prev_group``.

            If ``state_group`` is None (ie, the event is an outlier),
            ``state_group_before_event`` will always also be ``None``.

        state_delta_due_to_event: If `state_group` and `state_group_before_event` are not None
            then this is the delta of the state between the two groups.

        prev_group: If it is known, ``state_group``'s prev_group. Note that this being
            None does not necessarily mean that ``state_group`` does not have
            a prev_group!

            If the event is a state event, this is normally the same as
            ``state_group_before_event``.

            If ``state_group`` is None (ie, the event is an outlier), ``prev_group``
            will always also be ``None``.

            Note that this *not* (necessarily) the state group associated with
            ``_prev_state_ids``.

        delta_ids: If ``prev_group`` is not None, the state delta between ``prev_group``
            and ``state_group``.

        app_service: If this event is being sent by a (local) application service, that
            app service.

        partial_state: if True, we may be storing this event with a temporary,
            incomplete state.
