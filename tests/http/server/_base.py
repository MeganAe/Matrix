        Fails if:
            * A logging context is lost during cancellation.
            * A logging context get restarted after it is marked as finished, eg. if
              a request's logging context is used by some processing started by the
              request, but the request neglects to cancel that processing or wait for it
              to complete.

              Note that "Re-starting finished log context" errors get caught by twisted
              and will manifest in a different logging context error at a later point.
              When debugging logging context failures, setting a breakpoint in
              `logcontext_error` can prove useful.
            * A request gets stuck, possibly due to a previous cancellation.
            * The request does not return a 499 when the client disconnects.
              This implies that a `CancelledError` was swallowed somewhere.

        Note that this function can only cover a single code path and does not guarantee
        that an endpoint is compatible with cancellation on every code path.
        To allow inspection of the code path that is being tested, this function will
        log the stack trace at every `await` that gets cancelled. To view these log
        lines, `trial` can be run with the `SYNAPSE_TEST_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` environment
        variable, which will include the log lines in `_trial_temp/test.log`.
        Alternatively, `_log_for_request` can be modified to write to `sys.stdout`.

            test_name: The name of the test, which will be logged.
            expected_code: The expected status code for the final request that runs to
                completion. Defaults to `200`.
